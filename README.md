# Landing-Page

This is the 2nd Odin's project. It's all about practising to use flexboxes to create an entire webpage from given design.
Main things, that I'am going to deal with this project, are:
    1. Display: flex.
    2. Flex-directions, such as row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.
    3. Justify-content, such as flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.
    4. Align-items, such as flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch.
    5. Align-content, such as flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch.
    6. Recreate webpage from given design. 
    7. Divide webpage on different sections. Take one section at a time.
    8. Google some information, that have been used, but haven't been mentioned in course.
